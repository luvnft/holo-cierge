**Holo-cierge** is an innovative 3D digital concierge that bridges cutting-edge AI, immersive holographic display technology, and advanced animation to redefine guest services in hospitality. The system leverages **`ReactJS`**, **`Three.js`**, and **`Node.js`** to create an interactive, lifelike concierge experience compatible with [**Looking Glass**](https://lookingglassfactory.com/) holographic displays. By integrating [**OpenAI Whisper**](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for speech recognition and [**OpenAI ChatGPT**](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) as its core LLM, Holo-cierge can interpret guest inquiries, respond conversationally, and perform real-world actions such as creating tickets for hotel services through its integration with [**GuestHub**](https://guesthub.io/) hotel management application. Used **Docker** for backend containerization and deployment.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites üì¶

- Node.js and Yarn for dependency management.
- Python 3.8+ for running Whisper.
- FFmpeg for audio processing.
- Rhubarb Library for lipsync. [*Find here*](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync)

### Steps üìã

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rorosaga/holo-cierge.git
```
```bash
cd holo-cierge
```

2. **Backend Setup:**

- Navigate to `concierge-backend` directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd concierge-backend
```
```bash
yarn
```

- Set up the environment variables:
>- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your OpenAI API key, ElevenLabs API key, and Rhubarb executable path.

- Set up **Whisper** env:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate # MacOS/Linux
```
or
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows
```
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
- Navigate to `concierge-frontend` directory and install dependencies.

```bash
cd ../concierge-frontend
```
```bash
yarn
```

4. Install FFmpeg:
- For MacOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
- For Windows:
> Download the latest build from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH.

5. **Start the development servers:**
- Open two terminal windows, one in `concierge-backend` and the other in `concierge-frontend`.
- Start the backend server:
```bash
yarn dev
```
- Start the frontend server:
```bash
yarn start
```

## Usage üéÆ
